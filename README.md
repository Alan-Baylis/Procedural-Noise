# Procedural-Noise

This is a collection of procedural noise algorithms I have collected from various places over the years. They have been reworked into a common framework I use and can be added to a fractal noise object to turn the noise into a fractal. Each noise supports sampling in 1, 2 and 3 dimensions.
